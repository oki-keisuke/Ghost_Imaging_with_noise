# Ghost_Imaging_with_noise
Noise-free single-pixel Ghost Imaging: A 32 x 32 pixel image is illuminated with a random pattern and the scattered light is detected using a photodiode. Noise is applied to the image with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of Ïƒ. The image is then reconstructed using the correlation. The image is reconstructed using the correlation.
The relationship between SNR and CNR is also investigated.
